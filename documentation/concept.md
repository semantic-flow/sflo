## Overview

In the Semantic Flow framework, semantic meshes are collections of namespaced units of meaning called "mesh nodes." Mesh nodes are containers that hold flows and extend the namespace. Mesh elements are terminal resources that define or support a node’s structure. The IRI itself is the sign, while the node is the dereferenceable resource that embodies, describes, and organizes that sign.
