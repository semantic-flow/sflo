The "[[namespace base|concept.namespace.base]]" is first part of the URL under which all of a [[concept.semantic-site]]'s identifiers live. It is determined by the publishing platform.

Only sites have [[concept.namespace.base]]. Meshes (and sites) have [[concept.root-node]], which corresponds to the top level of othe mesh.

## Platform Options

Github pages presents two options:

- a root namespace that corresponds to an org/user, e.g. https://semantic-flow.github.io/
- a root namespace that corresponds to a repository of an org/usr, e.g. https://semantic-flow.github.io/weave/
