- An IRI should refer to only one thing
- this is NOT the "single name" principle; multiple IRIs can refer to the same thing

## Issues

- meaning evolves over time. An IRI that once meant one thing, will come to be something different. Perhaps with versioning readily available, specifying the version helps uphold this principle.
