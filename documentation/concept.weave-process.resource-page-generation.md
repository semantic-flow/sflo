- instead of generating to a docs folder or branch, the index files can just be generated in-place!
- every resource's [[mesh-resource.node-component.documentation-resource.resource-page]] could look completely different 
    - theoretically could even be generated by a different site generator
- weave + commit + push = publish!

## What Gets Included

- the [[mesh-resource.node-component.documentation-resource.readme]] would probably be the primary source in practice
- you could supplement with AI-generated
- you're limited only by what can be served statically, i.e., client-side, so you could have entire web applications hosted on a resource page
- for [[mesh-resource.node.payload]], check to see if there are any named graphs (which are hopefully identified relative to the node with fragment identifiers, e.g. /ns/djradon/bio/#childhood)
- for any embedded node whose IRI is a fragment of the subject, create an anchor with that fragment.
