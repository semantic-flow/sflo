## Definition

**Bare nodes** are [[mesh-resource.node]]s that function primarily as containers for other mesh nodes. They are physically represented by [[folder.namespace]].

## Purpose

- scaffolding, grouping, deferred semantics
- a secondary, optional function is as "semantic contextualizers", but bare nodes don't have any definitive [[concept.referent]] of their own.
