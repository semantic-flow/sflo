Intramesh relative identifiers (or **relative identifiers** for short) are relative IRIs that do not start with a slash (`/`), i.e., they are **relative-path relative IRIs** that correspond to a [[concept.mesh-location]] and denote an [[internal|facet.internal]] or [[external|facet.external]] referent..

Relative identifiers are always resolved relative to the distribution file that contains them.

See [[faq.reference-iri-choices]] for discussion and examples.
