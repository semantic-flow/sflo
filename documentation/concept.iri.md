On the semantic web, resources (things you might want to talk about with RDF statements) are identified with Internationalized Resource Identifiers. Traditionally, IRIs don't necessarily LOCATE a resource, i.e., if you put them in a web browser, they don't necessarily return content.

But with [[Semantic Flow sites|concept.semantic-flow-site]], all [[mesh-resource]] IRIs return a web page. 

## Types of IRIs

- Absolute IRIs
- Relative IRIs
  - Relative-Path Relative IRIs
  - Absolute-Path Relative IRIs 

See [[faq.reference-iri-choices]] for a discussion of IRI types.
