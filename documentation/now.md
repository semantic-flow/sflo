# Current Work Focus (Big Picture)

This document captures the high-level, current focus of development. It should be updated frequently to reflect the immediate priorities.

## Current Priority

Implementing the [[Agent Memory Bank|task.2025-11-03-optimizing-for-agents]] system and refining the core documentation to support AI-assisted development.

## Active Tasks

- Establishing project-level memory bank files (this task).
- Defining custom mode rules for agents to enforce memory bank usage.
- Refining the core concepts in [[concept.summary]].

## Blockers / Risks

- Ensuring all agents (human and AI) consistently use and maintain the memory bank files to prevent context drift.
- Full implementation of the Weave Process remains a large, pending task.

## Related Status

- [[guide.status]] - Overall project health and component status.
- [[todo]] - General list of pending tasks.
