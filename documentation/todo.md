# General Project TODO List

This list captures general tasks, ideas, and items that have not yet been broken down into formal, actionable tasks (i.e., `tasks.YYYY-MM-DD-task-name.md`).

## High Priority

- [ ] Finish conversion of SFLO Ontology to JSONLD, remove other files; add to guidance
- [ ] Implement the core Weave Process logic (versioning, promotion, link resolution).
- [ ] Define and implement the two-flow configuration inheritance model.
- [ ] Create initial unit and integration tests for `sflo-host`.
- [ ] Design sflo-web server-rendered architecture (Fastify view engine + HTMX partials)
- [ ] Logging Phase 2

## Grooming / Future Tasks

- [ ] Define a "Documentation Grooming" Roo Mode to periodically refine documentation for pithiness and consistency.
- [ ] Implement the `sflo-web` plugin for a basic web UI.

## Agent Maintenance Tasks

- [ ] Ensure all memory bank files are consistently updated as work progresses.
- [ ] Review and update [[dev.patterns]] as new architectural decisions are made.
- [ ] Review and update [[dev.dependencies]] when major dependencies are added or removed.
