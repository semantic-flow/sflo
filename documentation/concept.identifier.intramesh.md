## Purpose

- locate [[mesh-resource]]s (when used in a filesystem or web site context)
- denote [[concept.referent]]

Intramesh identifiers are like base-relative URIs (i.e., without the scheme, e.g., https:// or file://) except may not include fragments (#) or query separators (?). They correspond to the filesystem location of their corresponding resources. Intramesh identifiers are recorded within distributions and, where configuration is needed, under the nodeâ€™s operational config flow. Paths are always resolved relative to the distribution file that declares them.

If it starts with a `../` it refers to the parent, `../../` refers to the grandparent, etc.

## Identifier Semantics

Identifiers have the same semantics as [[concept.identifier]]

## Identifier Name Limitations

- initial underscores prefix all reserved dataset identifiers and should be avoided in general
![[sflo#^pnoqpr3ff4za]] 

## Examples

Directory structure: node/flow/snapshot/distribution.trig

Operational config example: `my-dataset/_config-operational-flow/_current/config.trig`  
Inheritable config example: `my-dataset/_config-inheritable-flow/_current/config.trig`  
Meta-flow example: `my-dataset/_meta-flow/_current/meta.trig`

Intramesh identifiers from meta-flow distributions:

Node self-reference: `"../../../my-dataset"`  
Other flows: `"../../_config-operational-flow/_current/config.trig"`, `"../../_config-inheritable-flow/_current/config.trig"`, `"../../_data-flow/_current/data.jsonld"`  
Components in other flows: Same pattern, just different flow names
