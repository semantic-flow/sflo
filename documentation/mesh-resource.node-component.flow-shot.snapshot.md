A snapshot dataset generated "on [[weave|concept.weave-process]]"

The [[folder.snapshot]] is named with the [[concept.weave-label]] plus the [[concept.flow-version]]

## Disambiguation

- a version snapshot is an addressable resource; 
- it is differentiated from the concept of a [[facet.flow.unversioned]] in that a versioned flow is a flow that has never had a version.
