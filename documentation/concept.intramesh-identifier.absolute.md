Intramesh absolute identifiers (or **absolute identifiers** for short) are relative IRIs that start with a slash (`/`), i.e., they are **absolute-path relative IRIs** that correspond to a [[concept.mesh-location]] and denote an [[internal|facet.internal]] or [[external|facet.external]] [[concept.referent]].


See [[faq.reference-iri-choices]] for discussion and examples.
