A mesh can be represented by a bunch of files and folders in a filesystem. But it is primarily a concept.

Conceptually, a mesh is composed of [[mesh-resource]]s. Those resources all have a **mesh location**: conceptual addresses that may be specified relative to each other ([[concept.identifier.intramesh.relative]]) or from the [[root node|concept.root-node]]. 

Mesh locations map cleanly to filesystem paths, and they work
