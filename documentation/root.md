**Dereferenceable, versioned semantic meshes** will be the foundation for a new era of knowledge graphs.

## What Is Semantic Flow?

**Semantic Flow** is a framework for managing and publishing resource identifiers, knowledge graphs and other semantic data by leveraging GitHub, Gitlab, and other free static hosting services. It enables a **dereferenceable Semantic Web** where every HTTP IRI returns meaningful content.

[[concept.mesh-repo]] provide storage, [[concept.mesh]] provide resource management and publishing, and [[concept.semantic-site]] support data discovery and explainability.

## Benefits

- own your own self-describing data and data schemas
- complete version history when you want it
- reliable persistence
- truly FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)

## Features

- seamlessly integrate other data sources anywhere in your mesh
- generate and customize mini-sites or single-page applications for nodes in your mesh
- see [[feature]] for a list of planned features
