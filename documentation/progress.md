## [[task.2025-11-03-optimizing-for-agents]] - Initial Memory Bank Structure

**Summary:** Implemented the initial set of project-level memory bank files to establish shared context for AI agents and human developers.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Created/updated core context files: [[guide.project-brief]], [[guide.product-brief]], [[guide.status]], [[dev.memory-bank]].
- Established initial content for frequently referenced files: [[dev.patterns]], [[dev.dependencies]], [[now]], [[todo]].
- Defined the structure for dated logs: [[progress]] (this file) and [[decision-log]].
- Confirmed the core rule: Agents must read all "Every Task Context" files.
  - but it didn't work very well. :/
