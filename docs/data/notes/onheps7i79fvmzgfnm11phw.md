On the semantic web, resources (things you might want to talk about with RDF statements) are identified with Internationalized Resource Identifiers. Traditionally, IRIs don't necessarily LOCATE a resource, i.e., if you put them in a web browser, they don't necessarily return content.

But in the Semantic Flow, all IRIs return a web page. 

See [[faq.reference-iri-choices]] for a discussion of IRI types.
