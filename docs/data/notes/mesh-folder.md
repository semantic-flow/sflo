Semantic meshes are represented in filesystems as a collection of folders and files. Mesh folders correspond to [[facet.resource.naming]].

With the exception of [[folder._assets]], **mesh folders** should only contain other [[mesh-resource]]s, i.e., other mesh folders and [[file]], no "arbitrary files."
