- one of the [[semantic flow elements|concept.mesh.resource.element]]
- used for attaching data to a [[concept.mesh.resource.node.reference]]
- logically, it's a [[concept.mesh.flow-facet.versioned]], so contains a [[concept.mesh.flow-facet.v-series]]
- physically represented as a [[concept.mesh.resource.folder._ref-flow]]
- not a [[concept.mesh.resource.node]], so doesn't have its own [[concept.mesh.resource.element.flow.metadata]]
