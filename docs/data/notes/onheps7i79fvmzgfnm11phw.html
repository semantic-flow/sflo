<p>In RDF-land, resources are identified with Internationalized Resource
Indicators. IRIs don't necessarily LOCATE a resource, i.e., if you put them in a
web browser, they don't necessarily return content.</p>
<p>In the Semantic Flow, all IRIs return a web page, so we just call them URLs.</p>
<p>Not to mention everybody knows what a URL is, but very few know what an IRI is.</p>
