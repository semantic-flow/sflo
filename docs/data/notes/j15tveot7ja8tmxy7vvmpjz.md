Flows with the **v-series flow facet** have at least one historical checkpoint, i.e. at some point a [[concept.weave-process]] has generated a [[resource.node-component.flow-snapshot.version]].


A [[facet.flow.versioned]] collects [[Version|resource.node-component.flow-snapshot.version]], so a v-series flow probably had versioning turned on for at least one weave.
