The node at the top of a repository file hierarchy may be referred to as the root node. It is the [[concept.namespace.base]], even if it is not a [[resource.node.bare]]. 

Every other [[resource]] in a mesh "lives under" the root folder, and its identifier is the folder name, which is usually the repo-name if it's being created as a [[concept.mesh-repo]]. 

It is not treated or represented any differently than any other [[resource.node]], and it is not differentiated in metadata (hopefully?)
