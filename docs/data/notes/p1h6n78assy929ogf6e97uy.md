# Semantic Flow (sflo) - Project Brief

This is the entry point for understanding the Semantic Flow project and its memory bank system.

## Essential Reading (Start Here)

**For AI Agents:** You MUST use the [[dev.memory-bank]] protocol and read the "Every Task" Context Files for every new task

## Key Concepts

Core abstractions are documented in detail:

- [[concept.mesh]] - Dereferenceable collection of semantic resources
- [[mesh-resource.node]] - Atomic unit of a mesh; provides a name to refer to something, and optionally, data about that thing
- [[mesh-resource.node-component.flow]] - data about the node or thing it names, in the abstract; possibly versioned
- [[mesh-resource.node-component.flow-snapshot]] - a version of a flow
- [[mesh-resource.node-component.snapshot-distribution]] - a file that concretizes a version of a flow
- [[concept.weave-process]] - Lifecycle operation for versioning/publishing

See [[concept.summary]] for more depth documentation.
