Semantic Flow sites provide two main services:

- hosting persistent, namespaced [[URLs|concept.identifier]] for use in the semantic web
- hosting versioned RDF datasets, and their histories

## Publishing

- For sites exposed by Github/Gitlab Pages functionality, pushing a [[concept.mesh-repo]] effectively publishes it.
