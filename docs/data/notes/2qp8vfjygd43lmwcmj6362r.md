Unlike most other [[resource.node-component.flow-snapshot]], the [[resource.node-component.flow-snapshot.next]] is [[user-facing|facet.user]] (directly modifiable), and so there shouldn't be any [[concept.sibling-distribution]]. Just the one distribution that may be updated, and if multiple-syntax weaving is turned-on, is the source for the siblings.

The [[product.cli]] should have functionality for converting the working distribution between formats, in case you want to change the syntax you're using.
