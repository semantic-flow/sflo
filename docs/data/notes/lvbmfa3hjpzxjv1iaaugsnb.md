**Namespace nodes** are [[mesh nodes|concept.mesh.resource.node]] that function primarily as containers for other mesh nodes. They are physically represented by [[concept.mesh.resource.folder.namespace]]

A secondary, optional function is as "semantic contextualizers", but namespace nodes don't have any clear [[related-topics.referent]] of their own.
