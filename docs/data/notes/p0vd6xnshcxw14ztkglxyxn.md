## Overview

In the Semantic Flow framework, semantic meshes are collections of namespaced units of meaning called "mesh nodes." Mesh nodes are containers that hold flows and extend the namespace. [[Node components|resource.node-component]] are terminal resources that define or support a nodeâ€™s structure. The IRI itself is the sign, while the node is the dereferenceable resource that embodies, describes, and organizes that sign.
