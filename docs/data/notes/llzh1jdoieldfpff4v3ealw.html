<h1 id="root-node">root node<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#root-node"></a></h1>
<p>The node at the top of a repository file hierarchy may be referred to as the root node. It is the <a href="/notes/f2dk7cwbol4o1jsnd0cun1g">namespace base</a>, even if it is not a <a href="/notes/lvbmfa3hjpzxjv1iaaugsnb">namespace node</a>. </p>
<p>Every other <a href="/notes/xmdevh3s6gvp93m3nyc6683">mesh resource</a> in a mesh "lives under" the root folder, and its identifier is the folder name, which is usually the repo-name if it's being created as a <a href="/notes/c4wo7mdjzcit2bmvqr5sx4u">mesh repo</a>. </p>
<p>It is not treated or represented any differently than any other <a href="/notes/8hmkiyjtsey7z8y5oi5xdxm">MeshNode</a>, and it is not differentiated in metadata (hopefully?)</p>
