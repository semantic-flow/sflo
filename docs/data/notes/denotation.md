Denotation is what an [[concept.identifier]] stands for —- the resource it names in your data and reasoning.

## Examples

- <ns/djradon/> might denote the person known as "dj radon" (a "concrete" referent [[concept.referent]])
- <ns/djradon/playlists/1996-11-10/> might denote a dataset which specifies the tracks played on a radio show (a more "abstract" referent)
